## Modudel 1 CTE Concepts  

* [APT 30](./Files/rpt-apt30.pdf)

### Lesson 1 – Extracting TTPs from Threat Reports

a. Find the “Key Findings” section of the report on page 4. What suite of tools was used for their long-term mission?
  *

b. What domains has APT30 been known to use?

c. What are the domains used for?

d. To emulate the threat, what malware tools would a CTE squad need?

e. Does APT30 develop any of their own tools?

e. Choose a tool or technique mentioned in the report and describe how the CTE squad could emulate the tool or technique.

* Participative Operatiions
  * Participative operations are conrolled evalutaion of a defenders's ability to idenify and respond to a specified adversary threat capability. CTE squads fire a specific capability in an annuncdd and controlled process alowing deender to reind bothe technological capailities and responsce processes to the threat
* Non-participative Operations
  * Non-participative operations are executed with out expressed awareness of the defensive capabilities against the threats being emulatd. silent operation are also used to validate tht freinedments implemented druing participative operations were efective and maintianed.

#### Execution Phases

* Survey
* Secure
* Protect
  * Receive/share threat updates, observe activity
  * Provie adversarial prespective and recommendtion courses of action for mitigation and premptions
  * Assist in ad hoc countermeasures development
* Recover
  * Ensure deliberate transfer of any staybehind capabilities
  * Provide recommendations for inclusion in final report

#### Eexecution Phase: Survey stage

* Corrdiinate, collect and share threat information
* Prepare a TEP to replicate required threats
* Support paricipative evaluation of existing defenses through corrdinationed execution of the TEP
* Provide recommendations to assist in risk assessment and inform RMP

#### Prepare the TEP (Threat Emulation Plan)
