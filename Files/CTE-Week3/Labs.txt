1) PowerShell week had some mis-Information in it.
    Get-WMIObject started in PowerShellv3 and is suppoted all the way throuh Windows PowerShellv5.1
      (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/get-wmiobject?view=powershell-5.1)
	Get-CimInstace has replaced Get-WmiObject starting in PowerShellv5 and supported throuh PowerShellv7.1.3
	    (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/cimcmdlets/get-ciminstance?view=powershell-5.1)
It might be wise to just touch on Get-WMIObject and hammer in on Get-CimInstace.  

2) Get rid of all the aliases in the workbook and lessons.  It is already hard enough to learn PowerShell, but then you top on the aliase which cause more stress to learn.  PowerShell was designed to be able to make sence when you read it, there for "For-eachobject" is easier to read and understnd then "%" and "Get-CimInstace" is easier to read than "GCIM".  I understand that these are "common" in scripts, but look at this alias. what is "GTZ"?  If you saw that in a script you would have to stop reading and go look it up.  GTZ is alias for Get-TimeZone.  Just quit being lazy and use your tab key.

3) It would have been nice to learn about VSCode vs. ISE.  VSCode does all the same thing ISE and even gives you wordwrap and is just more powerfull.  I get that ISE is built into the Microsoft operating system, but VSCode is cross platform and can be used for more than just PowerShell.

4) Week 3 we learned about the various reports and spent many hours learning to write them.  We then tested on it on friday.  After we did that, what is the point of doing it again on the very next Monday after only spending a couple of hours on a "new tool/technique"?  That seemed like a waste of a day when we could have had more hands on keyboard with the new tool/technique instead of re-writing a report we already tested on.

5)  I did not enjoy the fact we learned an inch of a tool and spent the rest of the day doing labs where we had to "Google" the information to complete the lab.  If this is the case, this course should be done as corrispondance.  I felt most of my time was wasted in doing this.

6) Lab machines need to be updated.  Most of the class talked about do Threat Emulation against DOD.  The DOD migrated away from Win7 over 10 years ago.  I understand that the attacks work better on Win7, but the students are getting setup for failer thinking an attack that worked on Win7 will work on Win10.  We should be focused on Win10 and if the student comes accross a Win7 box, they can "Google" it, there is plenty of documentation out ther.
	
Over all I felt my time was wasted, this is no fault to the instructors or DCITA.  I was only here because I did not have an "Official Methodologies" Cybercom course.  I think Cybercom needs to look at equivilant certifications to CTE.

7) Some labs seemed so vague that it I could not figure out what we were supposed to be doing.  In the tunneling lab I had issues out of one of my boxes so I only used 3 boxes.  The lab never stated I need all 4, it just said set up your tunnels.  That is what I did, I set up a tunnel from my Win machine through Kali to Ubuntu.  That is the walkthrough was completely different then how I interpreted the lab.  Lab 10.1 is extreamly Vague as well.  Why are we creating 2 "python scripts" using sudocode.  Go back to week 2, we are not supposed to be using real code, our sudocode should be able to translate to any language.  So, in sudocode There is no reason to create a Python 2 and 3 script to show the differences in input.	Also, the instructor demoed a functioning script, the instructions said to write sudocode, where did it tell me to writh a full functioning script?

8) Going from zero to hero is not the best way to teach Python or PowerShell.  It only causes frustration and discontent.  I understand we need to learn this, but going from this is how to connect to a web page to exploit the page tommorrow is insane.  We have not even fully learned how to interact with the webpage, now we need to have that stuff mastered so we can master exploiting a web page.  Only spending two hours on how to do this task is not helping either.  We could use a demo/walk through prior to just saying "here is the exercise, go!".  If all this time was just going to be here are the slide, and the exercises go do them; I could have done this course as a corrispondence and taken my time to fully learn the concepts and got more out of the course.

9) The internal environment is OK at best.  The issue I have is not having VSCode availalble to write code and needing to use my own.  In doing this I have to copy and paste my code, which I can do through the webgui.  I just have a problem with the small screeen when doing this.  My eyes tend to strain looking at the tiny text and I have to take breaks more often, thus taking my longer to complete the exercise.  If I go to long at looking at the tiny text, I have issues seeing the rest of the day.  If I could have a proper IDE in the environment, I would not need the copy and paste function, thus, I can adjust the screen to be bigger and increase the font.

10) The instructors need to learn time management.  I am getting exausted when an instructor talks for 90+ minutes
